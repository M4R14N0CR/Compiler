  <h1>Java Compiler Project</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project involves the creation of a simple compiler in Java, developed in three main phases: Lexical Analysis, Syntactic Analysis, and Semantic Analysis. The compiler reads source code, converts it into tokens, analyzes the structure of the code, and finally verifies that the code adheres to semantic rules.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Phases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Lexical Analysis:</strong> Scans the source code to identify tokens such as identifiers, numbers, operators, and punctuation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Syntactic Analysis:</strong> Uses a recursive descent parser with backtracking to validate the grammatical structure of the code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Semantic Analysis:</strong> Checks the correct declaration and usage of identifiers and ensures the program follows semantic rules.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    The compiler serves as a practical tool for understanding fundamental compiler construction techniques, transforming high-level code into a tokenized and validated form. It provides hands-on experience with the theory and application of language processing.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, this project illustrates the core phases in compiler design, from tokenization and parsing to semantic checking, offering valuable insights into the process of building compilers.
